Okay so I've started to read thr Rootkit Arsenal book and wanted to test my knowledge the only way I know by trying to build a malware and a rootkit.
I've some Idea about how it should work and explaining it as it grows

### Setup stage:
In this stage our innocent victim lets call him Vic runs an ordinary looking program which is our setup program.
Now, our setup program should download all the required DLLs for stage 1 in C: \\config\\bin
update the PATH variable to include that folder download all programs of stage 1.
Store them in a well hidden folder and should move our stage 1 starter program to startup folder so that next time the vic restarts his computer we should be able to do all the nefarious stuff.
